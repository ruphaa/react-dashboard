## Book finder App

Inspired from Florin pop's [Ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/Book-Finder-App.md).

Create an application that will allow users to search for books by entering a query (Title, Author, etc). Display the resulting books in a list on the page with all the corresponding data.

### User Stories

- [ ] User can enter a search query into an `input` field
- [ ] User can submit the query. This will call an API that will return an array of books with the corresponding data (**Title**, **Author**, **Published Date**, **Picture**, etc)
- [ ] User can see the list of books appearing on the page

### Bonus features

- [ ] For each item in the list add a link that will send the User to an external site which has more information about the book
- [ ] Implement a Responsive Design
- [ ] Add loading animations
